<h2>TALENTED PERSON OF OUR FAMILY</h2>
<p><font size="+2">My elder brother who is also my guide and good friend always considers family as his priority and family members hold the most important place in his heart.He is working as software engineer in banglore.He is really very talented. He is the one who guided me to take engineering.He studied in NITK.He got high score in JEE.But I could'nt get a good score.He secures me very well. He takes care of our family.He helps me in clarifying all my doubts.He also guides me about my future.He guides me towards the correct path.He also secures me very well.As a younger sister to my brother, I always grew up in his guidance, for matters on career choices to taking the right decisions in life.
No matter how big my brother would become, he is always the strong pillar of support and wonderful being for my parents.Every girl has a dream to have an elder brother who will never stop guiding her correctly and advising her through the path she takes.I am happy that I have a good brother.</p>
