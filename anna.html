<h2>TALENTED PERSON OF OUR FAMILY</h2>
<p><font size="+2">My elder brother who is also my guide and good friend always considers family as his priority and family members hold the most important place in his heart.He is working as software engineer in banglore.He is really very talented. He is the one who guided me to take engineering.He studied in NITK.He got high score in JEE.But I could'nt get a good score. He takes care of our family.He helps me in clarifying all my doubts.He also guides me about my future.He guides me towards the correct path.He also secures me very well.As a younger sister to my brother, I always grew up in his guidance, for matters on career choices to taking the right decisions in life.I love my brother very much.
