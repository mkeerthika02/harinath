<h2>To start with the hero of our family.......</h2>
<h2>MY DAD</H2>
<p><font size="+2">In every daughter's life every father will be a hero,but in my life my father is a super hero.My dad is a perfectionist.He follows each and every small rule.Let me give an example....Whenever there is a red signal for 60seconds,everyone keep their engines on,but my father turns off the engine. When I asked him, he said that if I one person turn off the engine,atleast one person will turn of the engine by seeing me.That will save the fuel for future generation.That is mydad.He is an ideal person.My father is my role model for many reasons. First and foremost I admire his passion for work. That is why he is so respected in his office as well. He is always there to help his colleagues even if it is not his work. In fact, one can always see him spending weekends helping others out. Moreover, my father is a simple man. He does not like expensive things and lives an easy and peaceful life. Also, he never shouts on anyone of us. I wonder if he ever gets angry on anything as he takes everything so calmly and takes his time to decide upon things.He is a good decision maker.He cares for us very much.</font></p><br><br>
<h2>Coming to the queen of our family...</h2>
<h2>MY MOM</h2><br>
<p> <font size="+2">My mom is the queen of our family.The most influential person for me in my life is my mother. I have a very strong admiration and respect for my mother She is working as a teacher.Everytime I see my mom I really get astonished by the way she manages her time.Daily she wakes up at 4:00am ad she cooks for me,my father,my brother and for herself. And she goes for the job. After coming from school and office,me,my brother and my father take rest for atleast an hour.My mom,she keeps on working until night 10:00pm without any rest.That is my mom. My mother is my first teacher.She teaches me very well. She is the one who taught me the human values,good habits and social behaviour.Whenever I find any difficulty in my studies my mother plays the role of teacher and solve my problem, when I get bored my mother plays the role of a friend and plays with me. My mother plays a different role in our family. She spends a sleepless night when any member of our family falls sick and takes proper care of us. She can sacrifice with a smiling face for the benefit of the family.</font></p><br>

<p><font size="+2">My elder brother who is also my guide and good friend always considers family as his priority and family members hold the most important place in his heart.He is working as software engineer in banglore.He is really very talented. He is the one who guided me to take engineering.He studied in NITK.He got high score in JEE.But I could'nt get a good score.He secures me very well. He takes care of our family.He helps me in clarifying all my doubts.He also guides me about my future.He guides me towards the correct path.He also secures me very well.As a younger sister to my brother, I always grew up in his guidance, for matters on career choices to taking the right decisions in life.
No matter how big my brother would become, he is always the strong pillar of support and wonderful being for my parents.Every girl has a dream to have an elder brother who will never stop guiding her correctly and advising her through the path she takes.I am happy that I have a good brother.</font></p>
