<h2>QUEEN OF OUR FAMILY</h2><br>
<p> <font size="+2">My mom is the queen of our family.The most influential person for me in my life is my mother. I have a very strong admiration and respect for my mother She is working as a teacher.Everytime I see my mom I really get astonished by the way she manages her time.Daily she wakes up at 4:00am ad she cooks for me,my father,my brother and for herself. And she goes for the job. After coming from school and office,me,my brother and my father take rest for atleast an hour.My mom,she keeps on working until night 10:00pm without any rest.That is my mom. My mother is my first teacher.She teaches me very well. She is the one who taught me the human values,good habits and social behaviour.Whenever I find any difficulty in my studies my mother plays the role of teacher and solve my problem, when I get bored my mother plays the role of a friend and plays with me. My mother plays a different role in our family. She spends a sleepless night when any member of our family falls sick and takes proper care of us. She can sacrifice with a smiling face for the benefit of the family.</p><br>
A sond dedicated to my mother....
