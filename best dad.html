<h2><b>MY HERO</b></h2>
<p><font size="+2">In every daughter's life every father will be a hero,but in my life my father is a super hero.My dad is a perfectionist.He follows each and every small rule.Let me give an example....Whenever there is a red signal for 60seconds,everyone keep their engines on,but my father turns off the engine. When I asked him, he said that if I one person turn off the engine,atleast one person will turn of the engine by seeing me.That will save the fuel for future generation.That is mydad.He is an ideal person.My father is my role model for many reasons. First and foremost I admire his passion for work. That is why he is so respected in his office as well. He is always there to help his colleagues even if it is not his work. In fact, one can always see him spending weekends helping others out. Moreover, my father is a simple man. He does not like expensive things and lives an easy and peaceful life. Also, he never shouts on anyone of us. I wonder if he ever gets angry on anything as he takes everything so calmly and takes his time to decide upon things.He is a good decision maker.He cares for us very much.</p><br><br>
